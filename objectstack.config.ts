/**
 * Root Development Configuration
 *
 * Aggregates all example apps for `pnpm serve` / `pnpm dev:server`.
 * This is NOT a deployable config — it's the monorepo dev entry point.
 *
 * Console supports two running modes:
 *   - MSW:    `pnpm dev`        — Vite dev server with MSW intercepting API calls in browser
 *   - Server: `pnpm dev:server` — Real ObjectStack API server + Vite console proxying to it
 *
 * Note: Examples are merged into a single AppPlugin (rather than separate AppPlugins)
 * because CRM and Kitchen Sink both define an `account` object, which would
 * trigger an ownership conflict in the ObjectQL Schema Registry.
 *
 * HotCRM (submodule at examples/hotcrm) is included as a real-world metadata
 * example.  Its objects are merged with deduplication — existing example objects
 * take priority so that seed data is preserved.
