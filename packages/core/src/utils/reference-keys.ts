/**
 * Backend object schemas follow the ObjectStack convention and name a
 * relational field's target object `reference`
 * (e.g. `{ type: 'lookup', reference: 'showcase_account' }`), while ObjectUI's
 * types — and most in-repo consumers — historically read `reference_to`
 * (some legacy configs also carry camelCase `referenceTo`). A consumer that
 * reads only one key silently loses the relation under the other convention:
 * the exact bug HeaderHighlight had (#2407 / PR #2587), where a served
 * `reference`-keyed lookup rendered a raw id.
 *
 * `normalizeFieldReferenceKeys` stamps BOTH snake_case keys onto the field
 * definition whenever any of the three spellings is present, so downstream
 * reads work regardless of which single key they check. It mutates the field
 * in place — the ObjectStack adapter caches the schema object and re-serves
 * it, so the one pass must stick — and is idempotent. Keys that are already
 * set are never overwritten.
 *
 * ## ⭐ Why this file also WARNS — objectui#6837 half 2
 *
 * Maintainer ruling, 2026-08-31 (第 6 场总监席决裁批 #14), 原文照录:
 *
 * > objectui不是前端的项目吗?后端的元数据只要对,前端按协议执行就行了呀
 *
 * Protocol normalization belongs on the SERVER; the front end just executes
 * the protocol. objectstack#13847 landed that half: a `field-reference-to-alias`
 * conversion rewrites stored `reference_to` → `reference` on the serve path and
 * in `os migrate meta`, so a spec-compliant backend now emits `reference` only.
 * This repo's half deleted the per-reader `reference_to` fallback arms that
 * existed to absorb the un-normalized shape.
 *
 * The ruling asked for that deletion to be AUDIBLE rather than silent, and this
 * is the cheap defence-in-depth pin it named, placed here as dispatched.
 * `@objectstack/spec` 17.2.0's `FieldSchema` is strict and refuses
 * `reference_to`, `referenceTo` and `target` by name with `unrecognized_keys`,
 * each carrying its own "did you mean → `reference`" rename (measured on the
 * installed package, with `reference` as the positive control and a nonsense
 * key as the negative one — the nonsense key gets no rename hint, so the hint
 * is alias-table membership, not boilerplate). So a def that reaches this choke
 * point spelling ONLY a legacy key came from a producer the spec would reject,
 * and the producer is where it gets fixed.
 *
 * ## ⛔ WHAT THIS WARNING DOES NOT COVER — state it, do not overclaim it
 *
 * This warning fires ONLY where this file runs, and this file runs at exactly
 * three production call sites, all of them ingestion choke points:
 *
 *   packages/app-shell/src/providers/MetadataProvider.tsx  (`ensureType`, metadata type `object`)
 *   packages/app-shell/src/providers/MetadataProvider.tsx  (`getItem`,    metadata type `object`)
 *   packages/data-objectstack/src/index.ts                 (ObjectStackAdapter.getObjectSchema)
 *
 * All three STAMP the def, so a def that triggers this warning is also a def
 * that still resolves. ⇒ The warning fires precisely where nothing is broken.
 *
 * ⚠️ The third of those is new in objectui#7650 and the count above used to
 * read TWO. The old count was true about where this file RAN and false about
 * the serve surface it was cited for: `MetadataProvider` normalized on its
 * LIST path only, so an object def fetched BY NAME — the published
 * `useMetadataItem` hook, and any cold-cache read behind it — was served with
 * whichever single spelling the producer stored. ⛔ Do not re-derive this list
 * by grepping for the call: derive it from the serve paths that hand an object
 * schema to a reader, and check each one calls in.
 *
 * ⚠️ The BREAK surface is the complement of that: `getObjectSchema` is a
 * required member of the published `DataSource` interface and the readers call
 * it on the generic `dataSource`, so a hand-written schema served through ANY
 * other `DataSource` reaches a reader RAW — it neither passes through here nor
 * warns. On that path the failure is exactly as silent as it was before.
 * Reader-side or shared-resolver diagnostics, which would cover it, remain an
 * open question on objectui#6837 (options B and C of its table §5).
 *
 * ⛔ Do not describe this pin as making the BYO break audible. It does not.
 *
 * ⛔ The stamping itself is deliberately UNCHANGED. It is the only thing
 * standing between a BYO `DataSource` and the break, and retiring it is a
 * separate decision with its own weight — not this card's.

/**
 * Warn once per (OBJECT name, field name, legacy spelling, target VALUE) rather
 * than once per call: the adapter re-serves a cached schema and
 * `MetadataProvider` re-normalizes on every metadata refresh, and a warning
 * that floods the console is a warning that gets muted.
 *
 * All four segments are load-bearing, and each is here because dropping it
 * makes the warning name less than a whole producer site:
 *
 *   - OBJECT — the same field name (`owner`, `account_id`) lives on many
 *     objects, and each is a SEPARATE place to fix. Keyed on the field alone
 *     the memo reports the first object and goes quiet for every other one,
 *     while the message names a field the reader then has to go hunting for.
 *     `normalizeSchemaReferenceKeys` has `schema.name` in hand, so the whole
 *     address is available for free.
 *   - FIELD and SPELLING — one line per mis-spelled key, so a producer with
 *     three broken fields gets three fixes, not one and a silence.
 *   - VALUE — a field carrying two different stale targets reports both. This
 *     mirrors `column-identity.ts`'s `warnedConflicts` memo, which keys on the
 *     value for exactly this reason.
 *
 * ⚠️ A def normalized OUTSIDE a schema (a bare `normalizeFieldReferenceKeys`
 * call) has no object to name; it warns under a placeholder rather than being
 * silently merged with a real object's entry.
