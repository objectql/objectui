# Building Blocks for the Web

Pre-built, production-ready UI blocks powered by ObjectUI's schema-driven architecture. Copy the JSON, paste into your application, and ship faster.

## What are Blocks?

Blocks are complete, ready-to-use UI patterns built with ObjectUI components. Unlike individual components, blocks are composed sections like login forms, pricing tables, dashboard cards, and more—ready to be dropped into your application.

## How to Use Blocks

1. **Browse** the block categories to find what you need
2. **Preview** the block in action with live examples
3. **Copy** the JSON schema from the code tab
4. **Paste** into your ObjectUI application
5. **Customize** by modifying the schema to match your needs

### Example: Using a Block

All blocks are defined as JSON schemas. Here's how simple it is:

```tsx
import { SchemaRenderer } from '@object-ui/react';

// Copy this JSON from any block
const loginBlockSchema = {
  type: "card",
  className: "max-w-md mx-auto",
  children: [
    // ... block schema here
  ]
};

// Render it in your app
function App() {
  return <SchemaRenderer schema={loginBlockSchema} />;
}
```

## Customization

Every block is fully customizable:

- **Styling**: Add or modify `className` properties with Tailwind classes
- **Content**: Change text, labels, and placeholders
- **Layout**: Adjust spacing, sizing, and arrangement
- **Behavior**: Add actions, data sources, and expressions
- **Themes**: Works automatically with your theme configuration

## Block Architecture

All blocks follow ObjectUI best practices:

- Built with composable components
- Use semantic HTML structure
- Follow accessibility guidelines
- Leverage Tailwind utility classes
- Support responsive breakpoints
- Include proper ARIA attributes

## Open Source & Free Forever

All blocks are open source under the MIT license. Use them in personal projects, commercial applications, or as inspiration for your own designs.
