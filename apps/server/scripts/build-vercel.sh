# Build script for Vercel deployment of @object-ui/server.
#
# Follows the Vercel deployment pattern:
#   - api/[[...route]].js is committed to the repo (Vercel detects it pre-build)
#   - esbuild bundles server/index.ts → api/_handler.js (self-contained bundle)
#   - The committed .js wrapper re-exports from _handler.js at runtime
#   - Console SPA is built and copied to public/ for serving the UI
#
# Steps:
#   1. Build the project with pnpm (includes console)
#   2. Bundle the API serverless function (→ api/_handler.js)
#   3. Copy console dist files to public/ for UI serving

echo "[build-vercel] Starting server build..."

# 1. Build the project with pnpm (from monorepo root)
# Build workspace packages (excluding site docs) and console
cd ../..
echo "[build-vercel] Building workspace packages..."
pnpm --filter '!@object-ui/site' --filter '@object-ui/*' --filter '@object-ui/console' run build
cd apps/server

# 2. Bundle API serverless function

# 3. Copy console dist files to public/ for UI serving

echo "[build-vercel] Done. Static files in public/, serverless function in api/[[...route]].js → api/_handler.js"
