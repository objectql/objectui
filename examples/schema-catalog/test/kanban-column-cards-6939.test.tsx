 *
 * objectui#6939, the `kanban` group — `KanbanColumn`'s card list.
 *
 * `packages/types` declared the member as `items`, in both halves of the
 * published surface (`complex.ts` and its zod mirror `complex.zod.ts`), while
 * every board reads `cards`. Re-measured on `origin/main` @ `78a3cc238`, the
 * base of this branch:
 *
 *   - `KanbanImpl.tsx`      12 lines read `.cards`,  0 read `.items`
 *   - `KanbanEnhanced.tsx`   8 lines read `.cards`,  0 read `.items`
 *   - `index.tsx`            `bucketCardsIntoColumns` reads `col.cards` twice,
 *                            each as `col.cards || []`
 *
 * (A same-shaped LIT control on the same two files — `.title` — returns 8 and
 * 3, so the two zeros above are readings and not a mis-shaped probe.)
 *
 * ## Why the render half is the discriminating half, and why it is inverted here
 *
 * objectui#6318's triage: a "correction" that renders identically proves the
 * SCHEMA was the wrong side. The tree-view row of this card cleared that bar by
 * rendering identically. This row clears the STRONGER, opposite-polarity bar —
 * "correcting" the fixtures toward the declaration does not merely change the
 * render, it EMPTIES THE BOARD. Measured through this file's harness on
 * `78a3cc238`, before either declaration was touched:
 *
 *   basic-kanban-board       `cards` 64 elements, "To Do2 … Design new feature …"
 *                            `items` 45 elements, "No cards3 columnsTo Do0 …"
 *   advanced-…-and-limits    `cards` 86 elements, "Backlog2 … User Authentication …"
 *                            `items` 58 elements, "No cards4 columnsBacklog0 …"
 *
 * `column.cards || []` in `bucketCardsIntoColumns` is the mechanism: under the
 * `items` spelling every column buckets to zero cards. So the accepted spelling
 * had to move to `cards` — renaming the twelve read sites instead would have
 * emptied every authored board.
 *
 * ## The accept-set move this pins (Clause-② surface)
 *
 * Before: the two catalog entries FAILED `safeValidateSchema` (": Invalid
 * input") and the `items` spelling PASSED. After: exactly reversed. That is a
 * published mirror's accept/reject behaviour moving, and a renamed member on a
 * published type — pinned in both directions below.
 *
 * ## The harness, and why identity is claimed only within it
 *
 * `kanban` resolves to `KanbanRenderer`, which is
 * `<Suspense><LazyKanban/></Suspense>` over `React.lazy(() =>
 * import('./KanbanImpl'))`. A bare render measures the Suspense fallback — one
 * `<div>` skeleton, empty `textContent`, which is the vacuous identity pin this
 * file must not be (it was the first reading taken here, and it was discarded).
 *
 * `measure()` therefore settles the boundary with `waitFor`, the same way the
 * sibling `catalog-gallery-render.test.tsx` settles it for these very entries
 * (its comment names `kanban` as one of its three `React.lazy` categories).
 * Side-effect-importing the lazy chunk at module scope would be faster, but the
 * only specifier that reaches it — `@object-ui/plugin-kanban/KanbanImpl` — is
 * not in the package's `exports` map and resolves solely through the repo's
 * vitest source alias. objectui#4325 ruled that shape out for
 * `@object-ui/fields`: a package's surface is its index, and one test's preload
 * does not justify minting permanent public API. The witness used here is a
 * column heading, which exists in BOTH the populated and the empty board, so
 * the wait cannot pass for one spelling and time out for the other.
 *
 * Absolute counts are harness-relative; identity within THIS harness is the claim.
 *
 * Three readings per tile, because a count alone cannot tell a swapped element
 * from an equal one: element count, a tag census, and the text — visible text
 * as a literal, plus a SHA-256 over the full `textContent` with the Radix
 * scroll-area `<style>` blocks included.
