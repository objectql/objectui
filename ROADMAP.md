# ObjectUI Development Roadmap

> **Last Updated:** February 21, 2026
> **Current Version:** v0.5.x
> **Spec Version:** @objectstack/spec v3.0.8
> **Client Version:** @objectstack/client v3.0.8
> **Target UX Benchmark:** 🎯 Airtable parity
> **Current Priority:** AppShell Navigation · Designer Interaction · Dashboard Config Panel · Airtable UX Polish

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

ObjectUI is a universal Server-Driven UI (SDUI) engine built on React + Tailwind + Shadcn. It renders JSON metadata from the @objectstack/spec protocol into pixel-perfect, accessible, and interactive enterprise interfaces.

**Where We Are:** Foundation is **solid and shipping** — 35 packages, 91+ components, 5,100+ tests, 78 Storybook stories, 42/42 builds passing, ~85% protocol alignment. SpecBridge, Expression Engine, Action Engine, data binding, all view plugins (Grid/Kanban/Calendar/Gantt/Timeline/Map/Gallery), Record components, Report engine, Dashboard BI features, mobile UX, i18n (11 locales), WCAG AA accessibility, Designer Phase 1 (ViewDesigner drag-to-reorder ✅), Console through Phase 20 (L3), and **AppShell Navigation Renderer** (P0.1) — all ✅ complete.

**What Remains:** The gap to **Airtable-level UX** is primarily in:
1. ~~**AppShell** — No dynamic navigation renderer from spec JSON (last P0 blocker)~~ ✅ Complete
2. **Designer Interaction** — ViewDesigner and DataModelDesigner have undo/redo, field type selectors, inline editing, Ctrl+S save, column drag-to-reorder with dnd-kit ✅
3. **Dashboard Config Panel** — Airtable-style right-side configuration panel for dashboards (data source, layout, widget properties, sub-editors, type definitions)
4. **Console Advanced Polish** — Remaining upgrades for forms, import/export, automation, comments
5. **PWA Sync** — Background sync is simulated only

## 🎯 P0 — Must Ship (v1.0 Blockers)

### P0.1 AppShell & Navigation Renderer

> **Last remaining P0 blocker.** Without this, Console cannot render a sidebar from `AppSchema` JSON.

- [x] Implement `AppSchema` renderer consuming spec JSON (name, label, icon, branding)
- [x] Build navigation tree renderer (7 nav item types: object, dashboard, page, url, report, action, group)
- [x] Implement `NavigationAreaSchema` support (business domain partitioning)
- [x] Implement mobile navigation modes (drawer/bottom_nav/hamburger)
- [x] Add permission guards (`requiredPermissions`, `visible`) on navigation items

---

## 🎯 P1 — UI-First: Airtable UX Parity

> **Priority #1.** All items below directly affect end-user experience. Target: indistinguishable from Airtable for core CRUD workflows.

### P1.1 Designer Interaction (ViewDesigner + DataModelDesigner)

> Source: ROADMAP_DESIGNER Phase 2. These two designers are the core user workflow.

**ViewDesigner:**
- [x] Column drag-to-reorder via `@dnd-kit/core` (replace up/down buttons with drag handles)
- [x] Add `Ctrl+S`/`Cmd+S` keyboard shortcut to save
- [x] Add field type selector dropdown with icons from `DESIGNER_FIELD_TYPES`
- [x] Column width validation (min/max/pattern check)

**DataModelDesigner:**
- [x] Entity drag-to-move on canvas
- [x] Inline editing for entity labels (click to edit)
- [x] Field type selector dropdown (replaces hardcoded `'text'` type)
- [x] Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (delete entity cascades to relationships)

**Shared Infrastructure:**
- [x] Implement `useDesignerHistory` hook (command pattern with undo/redo stacks)
- [x] Wire undo/redo to ViewDesigner and DataModelDesigner

### P1.2 Console — Forms & Data Collection

## ⚠️ Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| AppShell complexity (7 nav types, areas, mobile) | Start with static nav tree, add mobile modes incrementally |
| Designer DnD integration time | Use `@dnd-kit/core` (already proven in Kanban/Dashboard); ViewDesigner first |
| Airtable UX bar is high | Focus on Grid + Kanban + Form triad first; defer Gallery/Timeline polish |
| PWA real sync complexity | Keep simulated sync as fallback; real sync behind feature flag |
| Performance regression | Performance budgets in CI, 10K-record benchmarks |
