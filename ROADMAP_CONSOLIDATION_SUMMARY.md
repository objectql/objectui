## 🔄 Consolidation Process

### What Was Merged

✅ **Strategic Vision**
- Combined strategic goals from IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md and OBJECTOS_INTEGRATION_ROADMAP.md
- Unified targets: 10K stars, 50K downloads/week, $2M revenue

✅ **Current Status**
- Package maturity matrix from original ROADMAP.md
- Recent achievements (v0.5.0 features) from UPDATE_SUMMARY.md
- Current gaps analysis (P0, P1 priorities)

✅ **2026 Roadmap (Q1-Q4)**
- **Q1:** Test coverage, i18n, documentation, performance (from IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md)
- **Q2:** Spec alignment, multi-tenancy, RBAC, enterprise features (from OBJECTOS_INTEGRATION_ROADMAP.md)
- **Q3:** Real-time collaboration, plugin marketplace, visual designer, community (from both)
- **Q4:** ObjectUI Cloud, industry solutions, commercialization (from IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md)

✅ **Metrics & Targets**
- Consolidated quarterly targets table
- Test coverage: 80%+ (Q1), 90%+ (Q3-Q4)
- Spec alignment: 100% (Q2)
- Performance: LCP 600ms (Q1) → 400ms (Q4)
- Community: 1K stars (Q1) → 10K stars (Q4)

✅ **Resource Planning**
- Team structure: 15 people (from OBJECTOS_INTEGRATION_ROADMAP.md)
- Budget: $1,573,000 (consolidated and adjusted)
- Expected ROI: Year 1 $550K, Year 2 $2.2M

✅ **Risk Management**
- Technical risks (spec changes, performance, security)
- Market risks (competition, adoption)
- Team risks (turnover, recruitment)

### What Was Removed

❌ **Duplicates**
- Redundant phase descriptions across multiple documents
- Overlapping feature lists
- Repeated success criteria

❌ **Excessive Detail**
- Implementation code examples (kept in source docs)
- Detailed technical schemas (referenced source docs instead)
- Verbose explanations (condensed to actionable items)

❌ **Outdated Information**
- Historical context not relevant to forward planning
- Completed items from old roadmap
- Console-specific tasks (kept in apps/console/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md)

### What Was Preserved

✅ **Source Documents**
- All original planning documents remain unchanged
- IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md - detailed technical specs
- OBJECTOS_INTEGRATION_ROADMAP.md - integration architecture
- apps/console/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md - console-specific tasks
- UPDATE_SUMMARY.md - recent updates reference

✅ **Reference Section**
- New ROADMAP.md includes clear references to all source documents
- Users can drill down into details by reading source docs
