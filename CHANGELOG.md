## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **CRM Enterprise Lookup Metadata** (`examples/crm`): All 14 lookup fields across 8 CRM objects now have enterprise-grade RecordPicker configuration — `lookup_columns` (with type hints for cell rendering: select, currency, boolean, date, number, percent), `lookup_filters` (base business filters using eq/ne/in/notIn operators), and `description_field`. Uses post-create `Object.assign` injection pattern to bypass `ObjectSchema.create()` Zod stripping (analogous to the listViews passthrough approach).
- **Enterprise Lookup Tests** (`examples/crm`): 12 new test cases validating lookup_columns presence & type diversity, lookup_filters operator validity, description_field coverage, and specific business logic (e.g., active-only users, non-cancelled orders, open opportunities).
- **RecordPickerDialog Component** (`@object-ui/fields`): New enterprise-grade record selection dialog with multi-column table display, pagination, search, column sorting with `$orderby`, keyboard navigation (Arrow keys + Enter), loading/error/empty states, and single/multi-select support. Responsive layout with mobile-friendly width. Provides the foundation for Salesforce-style Lookup experience.
- **LookupField Popover Typeahead** (`@object-ui/fields`): Level 1 quick-select upgraded from Dialog to Popover for inline typeahead experience (anchored dropdown, not modal). Includes "Show All Results" footer button that opens the full RecordPickerDialog (Level 2).
- **LookupFieldMetadata Schema Enhancement** (`@object-ui/types`): Added `lookup_columns`, `description_field`, `lookup_page_size`, `lookup_filters` to `LookupFieldMetadata`. New `LookupColumnDef` interface with `type` hint for cell formatting. New `LookupFilterDef` interface for base filter configuration.

### Changed

- **@objectstack v3.2.6 Upgrade**: Upgraded all `@objectstack/*` packages from `^3.2.5` to `^3.2.6` across 13 package.json files (43 references)
- **@objectstack v3.0.4 Upgrade**: Upgraded all `@objectstack/*` packages from `^3.0.2` to `^3.0.4` across 42 references
- **@objectstack v3.0.0 Upgrade**: Upgraded all `@objectstack/*` packages from `^2.0.7` to `^3.0.0` across 13 package.json files
- **Breaking change migrations**:
  - `Hub` namespace → `Cloud` in @object-ui/types re-exports
  - `definePlugin` removed (only `defineStack` remains)
  - `PaginatedResult.value` → `.records` across all data plugins and adapters
  - `PaginatedResult.count` → `.total` in data-objectstack adapter
  - `client.meta.getObject()` → `client.meta.getItem('object', name)` in data adapter
- Updated spec version references across ROADMAP.md, SPEC_COMPLIANCE_EVALUATION.md, OBJECTSTACK_CLIENT_EVALUATION.md, and console docs
- Updated ROADMAP with v3.0.0 migration table and next phase roadmap (N.1-N.5)
- Updated namespace-exports tests to reflect v3.0.0 exports

### Added

- **Preview Mode** (`@object-ui/auth`): New `previewMode` prop on `AuthProvider` for auto-login with simulated identity — skip login/registration for marketplace demos and app showcases. Includes `PreviewBanner` component, `isPreviewMode` / `previewMode` on `useAuth()`, and `PreviewModeOptions` type. Aligns with `@objectstack/spec` kernel `PreviewModeConfig`.
- **Discovery Preview Detection** (`@object-ui/react`): Extended `DiscoveryInfo` with `mode` and `previewMode` fields for server-driven preview mode detection.
- **Console Preview Support**: `ConditionalAuthWrapper` auto-detects `mode === 'preview'` from server discovery and configures auth accordingly.
- **Console Bundle Optimization**: Split monolithic 3.7 MB main chunk into 17 granular cacheable chunks via `manualChunks` — main entry reduced from 1,008 KB gzip to 48.5 KB gzip (95% reduction)
- **Gzip + Brotli Compression**: Pre-compressed assets via `vite-plugin-compression2` — Brotli main entry at 40 KB
- **Bundle Analysis**: Added `rollup-plugin-visualizer` generating interactive treemap at `dist/stats.html`; new `build:analyze` script
- **Lazy MSW Loading**: MSW mock server now loaded via dynamic `import()` — fully excluded from `build:server` output (~150 KB gzip saved)
- **ROADMAP Console v1.0 Section**: Added production release optimization roadmap with detailed before/after metrics
