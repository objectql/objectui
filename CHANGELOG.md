## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **ObjectDataTable: columns now support `string[]` shorthand** (`@object-ui/plugin-dashboard`): `ObjectDataTable` now normalizes `columns` entries so that both `string[]` (e.g. `['name', 'close_date']`) and `object[]` formats are accepted. String entries are automatically converted to `{ header, accessorKey }` objects with title-cased headers derived from snake_case and camelCase field names. Previously, passing a `string[]` caused the downstream `data-table` renderer to crash when accessing `col.accessorKey` on a plain string. Mixed arrays (some strings, some objects) are also handled correctly. Includes 8 new unit tests.

### Fixed

- **CI Build Fix: Replace dynamic `require()` with static imports** (`@object-ui/plugin-view`): Replaced module-level `require('@object-ui/react')` calls in `index.tsx` and `ObjectView.tsx` with static `import` statements. The dynamic `require()` pattern is not supported by Next.js Turbopack, causing the docs site build to fail during SSR prerendering of the `/docs/components/complex/view-switcher` page with `Error: dynamic usage of require is not supported`. Since `@object-ui/react` is already a declared dependency and other files in the package use static imports from it, replacing the `require()` with static imports is safe and eliminates the SSR compatibility issue.

- **CI Build Fix: Remove unused `...rest` parameter** (`@object-ui/plugin-calendar`): Removed unused `...rest` destructured parameter from `ObjectCalendar` component props (TS6133), which caused the declaration file generation to emit a TypeScript error during the build.

- **CI Build Fix: Unused Parameters in Test Mocks** (`apps/console`): Fixed TypeScript `noUnusedParameters` errors (TS6133) in `ListToolbarActions.test.tsx` where mock component `props` parameters were declared but never used in `@object-ui/plugin-kanban` and `@object-ui/plugin-calendar` mocks, causing the console `tsc` build step to fail in CI.

- **i18n loadLanguage Not Compatible with Spec REST API Response Format** (`apps/console`): Fixed `loadLanguage` in `apps/console/src/main.tsx` to correctly unwrap the `@objectstack/spec` REST API envelope `{ data: { locale, translations } }`. Previously, the function returned the raw JSON response, which meant `useObjectLabel` and `useObjectTranslation` hooks received a wrapped object instead of the flat translation map, causing business object and field labels (e.g., CRM contact/account) to fall back to English. The fix extracts `data.translations` when the spec envelope is detected, while preserving backward compatibility with mock/dev environments that return flat translation objects. Includes 6 unit tests covering spec envelope unwrapping, flat fallback, HTTP errors, network failures, and edge cases.

- **List Toolbar Action Buttons Not Responding** (`apps/console`): Fixed a bug where schema-driven action buttons in the upper-right corner of the list view (rendered via `action:bar` with `locations: ['list_toolbar']`) did not respond to clicks. The root cause: the console `ObjectView` component rendered these action buttons via `SchemaRenderer` without wrapping them in an `ActionProvider`. This caused `useAction()` to fall back to a local `ActionRunner` with no handlers, toast, confirmation, or navigation capabilities — so clicks executed silently with no visible effect. Added `ActionProvider` with proper handlers (toast via Sonner, confirmation dialog, navigation via React Router, param collection dialog, and a generic API handler) to the console `ObjectView`, following the same pattern already used in `RecordDetailView`. Includes 4 new integration tests validating the full action chain (render, confirm, execute, cancel).

- **CRM Seed Data Lookup References** (`examples/crm`): Fixed all CRM seed data files to use natural key (`name`) references for lookup fields instead of raw `id` values. The `SeedLoaderService` resolves foreign key references by the target object's `name` field (the default `externalId`), so seed data values like `order: "o1"` or `account: "2"` could not be resolved and were set to `null`. Updated all 8 affected data files (`account`, `contact`, `opportunity`, `order`, `order_item`, `opportunity_contact`, `project_task`, `event`) to use human-readable name references (e.g., `order: "ORD-2024-001"`, `product: "Workstation Pro Laptop"`, `account: "Salesforce Tower"`). This fixes the issue where Order and Product columns displayed as empty in the Order Item grid view.

### Added

- **Lookup Field Selection Display Fix** (`@object-ui/fields`): Fixed a bug where selecting a record from the RecordPickerDialog (Level 2 popup) produced no visible feedback in the LookupField. The root cause: `findOption` only searched static and popover-fetched options, which did not include records loaded by the dialog. Added `onSelectRecords` callback to `RecordPickerDialogProps` that returns full record objects alongside IDs. LookupField now caches selected records from the dialog and displays their labels/badges correctly. Both single-select and multi-select modes are supported. Includes a `selectedRecordsMap` ref in RecordPickerDialog that persists selected record data across page navigation for multi-select scenarios.

- **RecordPickerDialog UI/UX Overhaul** (`@object-ui/fields`): Major enterprise-grade improvements referencing mainstream low-code platforms:
  - **Skeleton Loading Screen**: Replaced simple spinner with a table-shaped skeleton screen during initial data load, matching the column layout for a polished loading experience.
  - **Sticky Table Header**: Table header now sticks to the top during vertical scroll, keeping column labels visible at all times.
  - **Loading Overlay**: Subsequent data fetches (page navigation, sorting, filtering) show a semi-transparent overlay with spinner over the existing data, preventing layout jank.
  - **Page Jump Input**: New input field in pagination bar allows users to type a page number and press Enter to jump directly to any page.
  - **Enhanced Search Bar**: Redesigned with a subtle background container and borderless input for a cleaner, more modern appearance.
  - **Improved Table Styling**: Even/odd row striping (`bg-muted/20`), refined selected-row highlighting (`bg-primary/5`), uppercase column headers with tighter tracking, rounded table border, and improved cell padding.
  - **Responsive Dialog**: Responsive dialog sizing from `sm:max-w-3xl` to `lg:max-w-5xl` for optimal data density across screen sizes; filter panel supports 3-column layout on wide viewports (`lg:grid-cols-3`).
  - **Fixed Close-Reset Cycle**: Separated dialog close-reset logic into its own `useEffect` (depends only on `open`) to prevent cascading state updates that could trigger React Error #185 (Maximum update depth exceeded) when selecting a record.
  - **8 New Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for skeleton loading (column count validation), sticky header classes, page jump navigation (valid/invalid/single-page), and loading overlay behavior.

- **"Browse All" Button for Lookup Fields** (`@object-ui/fields`): Added an always-visible "Browse All" (table icon) button next to the Lookup quick-select trigger. Opens the full RecordPickerDialog directly, regardless of record count — making enterprise features (multi-column table, sort/filter bar, cell renderers) discoverable at all times. Previously, the dialog was only accessible via the "Show All Results" in-popover button, which only appeared when total records exceeded the page size. The button uses accessible `aria-label`, `title`, and Lucide `TableProperties` icon. Keyboard and screen reader accessible.
- **CRM Enterprise Lookup Metadata** (`examples/crm`): All 14 lookup fields across 8 CRM objects now have enterprise-grade RecordPicker configuration — `lookup_columns` (with type hints for cell rendering: select, currency, boolean, date, number, percent), `lookup_filters` (base business filters using eq/ne/in/notIn operators), and `description_field`. Uses post-create `Object.assign` injection pattern to bypass `ObjectSchema.create()` Zod stripping (analogous to the listViews passthrough approach).
- **Enterprise Lookup Tests** (`examples/crm`): 12 new test cases validating lookup_columns presence & type diversity, lookup_filters operator validity, description_field coverage, and specific business logic (e.g., active-only users, non-cancelled orders, open opportunities).
- **RecordPickerDialog Component** (`@object-ui/fields`): New enterprise-grade record selection dialog with multi-column table display, pagination, search, column sorting with `$orderby`, keyboard navigation (Arrow keys + Enter), loading/error/empty states, and single/multi-select support. Responsive layout with mobile-friendly width. Provides the foundation for Salesforce-style Lookup experience.
- **LookupField Popover Typeahead** (`@object-ui/fields`): Level 1 quick-select upgraded from Dialog to Popover for inline typeahead experience (anchored dropdown, not modal). Includes "Show All Results" footer button that opens the full RecordPickerDialog (Level 2).
- **LookupFieldMetadata Schema Enhancement** (`@object-ui/types`): Added `lookup_columns`, `description_field`, `lookup_page_size`, `lookup_filters` to `LookupFieldMetadata`. New `LookupColumnDef` interface with `type` hint for cell formatting. New `LookupFilterDef` interface for base filter configuration.

### Added

- **Preview Mode** (`@object-ui/auth`): New `previewMode` prop on `AuthProvider` for auto-login with simulated identity — skip login/registration for marketplace demos and app showcases. Includes `PreviewBanner` component, `isPreviewMode` / `previewMode` on `useAuth()`, and `PreviewModeOptions` type. Aligns with `@objectstack/spec` kernel `PreviewModeConfig`.
- **Discovery Preview Detection** (`@object-ui/react`): Extended `DiscoveryInfo` with `mode` and `previewMode` fields for server-driven preview mode detection.
- **Console Preview Support**: `ConditionalAuthWrapper` auto-detects `mode === 'preview'` from server discovery and configures auth accordingly.
- **Console Bundle Optimization**: Split monolithic 3.7 MB main chunk into 17 granular cacheable chunks via `manualChunks` — main entry reduced from 1,008 KB gzip to 48.5 KB gzip (95% reduction)
